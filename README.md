# Space-Race

Space Race was created in Open Frameworks using an Arduino and distance sensors.

This was the final project for my Sensor Based Interaction class, created in collaberation with Josh van der Linden.

A video of the game being played can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfQS5Q-6j8c)
